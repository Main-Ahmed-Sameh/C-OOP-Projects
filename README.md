# C++ Object-Oriented Programming Projects

Welcome! This repository archives a collection of C++ projects built to demonstrate and practice the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It serves as both a personal log of my own learning journey and a practical resource for any student or developer looking to solidify their understanding of object-oriented design.

## 🎯 Core Concepts

Each project is a practical exercise focused on implementing the four fundamental pillars of OOP:

* **Inheritance**
* **Polymorphism**
* **Encapsulation**
* **Abstraction**

Through these projects, you will find concrete examples of how these concepts interoperate to build modular, flexible, and maintainable C++ applications.

## 🧠 Learn from the Process

This repository values the process as much as the product. Beyond just the final source code, each project folder includes images documenting the **ideation and brainstorming process**. This behind-the-scenes look is intended to show the planning, whiteboarding, and design decisions that led to the final structure.

The goal is to provide a complete "from scratch" guide. New developers are encouraged to **fork this repo**, review the planning materials,and then challenge themselves to build the project before comparing it with the final solution. This active-learning approach is highly recommended for building deep comprehension.

## 🤝 Contributions

Your input is valuable! If you have any suggestions for improvement, ideas for new projects, or find any bugs, please feel free to open an issue or **submit a pull request**. Whether it's a documentation fix, a code refactor, or a new feature, all contributions are welcome and greatly appreciated.
